<!--

O MATHEMATICAL HW (due at the beginning of class) <br>
<br>

Math 720 students may count the 420 problems within the problems solved, but not within the problems turned in.<br>
All assigned problems are from Bona's "A walk through combinatorics" (3rd edition) unless otherwise stated.<br>
<br><br>

hw 1 (thu feb 2) <br>
Solve at least 5 problems, turn in your best 3. <br>
o (420 only) 1.16 <br>
o 1.20 <br>
o 1.23 <br>
o 1.26 <br>
o 1.31 <br>
o 1.33 <br>
o Prove that there is a power of 2 whose first 2017 digits are 10000...0. <br>
<br>

hw 2 (thu feb 9) <br>
A. (In groups) Let f(n) be the smallest number for which the following statement is true: "Any deck of n cards in any order, we can sort using at most f(n) comparisons." What can you say about f(13)? f(52)? f(n)? <br>
B. (Individual.) Solve at least 3 problems, turn in your best one. <br>
o (420 only) 2.20 <br>
o 2.21 <br>
o 2.28 <br>
o 2.33 <br>
o 2.35 <br>
<br>
<br>


O BONUS PROBLEMS (due anytime) <br>
<br>
bonus 1 (In groups of 3-5.) <br>
(a) Prove that, no matter where the 29 of us are in the classroom (Thornton Hall 211), there are two of us at a distance of at most x from each other. (The smaller your x, the better.) <br>
(b) Find a way of distributing the 29 of us in the classroom so that the minimum distance between two of us is y. (The larger your y, the more impressive your construction will be.)
<br>

<br>
<br>


O READINGS (due dates) <br>
o thu jan 26, tue jan 31: Chapter 1<br>
o thu feb 1, tue feb 6: Chapter 2<br>
o thu feb 8, tue feb 13: Chapter 3<br>
<br><br>




O OTHER HW (due at the beginning of class) <br>
<br>

daily (in alphabetical order):  <br> 
I want to continue playing some music before class and in between things, to bring some more light into that classroom. On your designated day, please pick a song to share that makes you feel comfortable / joyful / at home. If you'd like to, you can tell us a bit about the song or why it's meaningful to you. <br>
You can send me a link to the song the day before, or bring a record and let me know to bring the record player that day. <br>

<br>
assignment 1 (thu jan 26) <br> 
Reread the Agreement in the syllabus, and the list of words that we used to describe Carlos Embales' guaguancó, and which I think should (mostly) apply to our class this semester: 
<br>
. community . joy . polyrhythm . family . crescendo . playful . encouraging . unexpected . churchlike . inviting . dancing . conversation . courage . motivation . cheerful . Spanish . learning . rhythm . celebration . style . culture . festive . <br>
In the groups formed in class, please write down 2-3 concrete practices we can follow that will help us create this atmosphere and achieve the goals of the agreement. 

<br><br>
assignment 2 (tue jan 31) <br> 
Write a 2 page mathematical autobiography. Some guiding questions: <br>
How did you become interested in mathematics? What are some of your most memorable (positive and negative) mathematical experiences? What do you like and dislike the most about mathematics? What is your favorite way of learning mathematics? <br>
Of course there is no wrong answer here. The goal of this assignment is for you to reflect on your own mathematical experience, and to help me understand your mathematical practices and plan the best possible course for you.

O TEXTBOOK <br> 
Miklos Bona, A walk through combinatorics (3rd edition).<br>
<br>
<br>



O SUPPLEMENTARY BOOKS <br> 

This is a nice <a href="latex.pdf">LaTeX guide</a>. <br>
<br>
You may find is a useful supplement to the course material: <br>
Richard Brualdi, Introductory Combinatorics. <br>
<br>
These texts contain more advanced topics, and would be good sources of ideas for the final project: <br> 
Richard Stanley, Algebraic Combinatorics: Walks, Trees, Tableaux, and More.
<br>
Federico Ardila, <a href="http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/Articles/methods.pdf">Algebraic and geometric methods in enumerative combinatorics</a> (Ch. 1 of the Handbook of Enumerative Combinatorics, ed. by M. Bona.)  <br>
