When I am not at work, you might find me: <br><br> 

Learning with, exploring with, growing with, changing with, organizing with, DJing with, cooking with, building with, playing with <a href="mayli.html">May-Li</a>. If you browse her <a href="http://www.maylikhoe.com">website</a> you will learn a lot about a lot of things. You will also recognize, very clearly, how much she influences my work and my world view.<br>
<br>

Learning how to play the Afro-Colombian marimba de chonta from maestres 
from the Colombian Pacific coast, and sharing the music we love 
with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/neblinasdelpacifico/">Neblinas del Pac&iacute;fico</a>. 
Our official recordings are on That's Love Records 
<a href="https://thatsloverecords.com/products/neblinas-del-pacifico-y-eryen-korath-fandango-arrullo-y-batey-45">on vinyl</a>
and on most streaming platforms.
Upcoming events and informal video and audio links are listed <a href="http://bento.me/neblinas">here</a>. 
<br>
<br>

Collecting records and sharing them with our Oakland-based DJ Collective <a href="http://lapelanga.com">La Pelanga</a>. 
For many years I contributed to our music <a href="http://lapelanga.com/author/papicultor/">blog</a> which now has 
many broken links. 
We also had a <a href="http://lapelanga.com/la-pelanga-en-la-sala-the-podcast/">podcast</a> way back in 2014. 
I still like this <a href="https://soundcloud.com/la-pelanga/la-pelanga-mixtape-vol-1">mixtape</a> we made in 2012, 
and others that I can give you if you still have a CD player, ha!  <br>
<br>
 
On the <a href="futbol.html">f&uacute;tbol</a> field. (Ya no; colgu&eacute;e los guayos :( )<br> 
<br>
