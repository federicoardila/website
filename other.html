Sometimes I <a href="http://twitter.com/federicoardila">tweet</a>, often about math.

When I am not at work, you might find me: <br><br> 

Learning with, exploring with, growing with, organizing with, DJing with, cooking with, building with, playing with <a href="mayli.html">May-Li</a>. If you browse her <a href="http://www.maylikhoe.com">website</a> you will learn a lot about a lot of things. You will also recognize, very clearly, how much she influences my work and my world view.<br>
<br>

Learning how to play  <a href="videos/AliCuama.mp4">marimba music</a> from maestras and maestros from the Colombian Pacific coast, and sharing the music we love with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itisfederico/">Neblinas del Pac&iacute;fico</a> when the pandemic lets us play in public again!  <br>
<br>

Collecting records and sharing them with our Oakland-based DJ Collective <a href="http://lapelanga.com">La Pelanga</a>. 
For many years I contributed to our music <a href="http://lapelanga.com/author/papicultor/">blog</a>. We also had a <a href="http://lapelanga.com/la-pelanga-en-la-sala-the-podcast/">podcast</a> way back in 2014. I still like this <a href="https://soundcloud.com/la-pelanga/la-pelanga-mixtape-vol-1">mixtape</a> we made in 2012, and others that I can give you if you still have a CD player, ha!  <br>
<br>
 
On the <a href="futbol.html">f&uacute;tbol</a> field.<br>
<br>
