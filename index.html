I am a mathematician working in combinatorics and its connections to geometry, algebra, topology, and applications. 
<!-- Among other things, I like thinking about polytopes, matroids, hyperplane arrangements, Coxeter groups, Hopf algebras, and tropical geometry. -->
I work towards fostering an increasingly just, equitable, and welcoming community of mathematicians that benefits from our differences and serves the needs of all communities.
<br>
<br>
Since January 2026, I am <a href="https://royalsociety.org/news/2025/06/wolfson-fellowships-2025/">Royal Society Wolfson Fellow</a> of the United Kingdom and (non-administrative) 
<a href="https://www.seresearch.qmul.ac.uk/ccant/news/5263/professor-federico-ardila-joining-qmul-in-january-2026/">Chair of Combinatorics</a> at Queen Mary University of London.

In <a href="http://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf">Todos Cuentan</a> 
	I wrote some axioms that have been a useful foundation for my educational and <a href="http://www.fardila.com/outreach">outreach efforts</a>. 
	I also find them far from perfect, a constant work in progress, as any work of this sort must be. 
	Since several mathematicians have posted them on their websites, I'll post some slightly updated ones:
<br>

<p style="font-size:20px">
Axiom 1. Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
<br>
<br>
Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
<br>
<br>
Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
<br>
<br>
Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
</p>

These statements should not sound revolutionary, but considering the current practices of the mathematical society, 
they are a pressing call to action. They also
