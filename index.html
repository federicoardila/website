<br><br><br>
I am a mathematician working in combinatorics and its connections to geometry, algebra, topology, and applications. 
<!-- Among other things, I like thinking about polytopes, matroids, hyperplane arrangements, Coxeter groups, Hopf algebras, and tropical geometry. -->
I work towards fostering an increasingly just, equitable, and welcoming community of mathematicians that benefits from our differences and serves the needs of all communities.

In <a href="http://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf">Todos Cuentan</a> I wrote some axioms became a useful foundation for my educational and outreach efforts. Since several mathematicians have kindly posted them on their websites, I'll post them too:
<br>

<p style="font-size:20px">
Axiom 1. Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
<br>
<br>
Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
<br>
<br>
Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
<br>
<br>
Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
</p>

These statements should not sound revolutionary, but
considering the current practices of the mathematical
society, they are a pressing call to action.
