About me: I am a Colombian-American mathematician working in combinatorics and its connections to geometry, algebra, topology, and applications. 
<!-- Among other things, I like thinking about polytopes, matroids, hyperplane arrangements, Coxeter groups, Hopf algebras, and tropical geometry. -->
I work towards fostering an increasingly just, equitable, and welcoming community of mathematicians that benefits from our differences and serves the needs of all communities.

About my job: Since 2026, I am <a href="https://royalsociety.org/news/2025/06/wolfson-fellowships-2025/">Royal Society Wolfson Fellow</a> of the United Kingdom and (non-administrative) 
<a href="https://www.seresearch.qmul.ac.uk/ccant/news/5263/professor-federico-ardila-joining-qmul-in-january-2026/">Chair of Combinatorics</a> at Queen Mary University of London.

About my outreach work: In <a href="http://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf">Todos Cuentan</a> 
	I wrote some axioms that have been a useful foundation for my educational and outreach efforts. 
	I also find them far from perfect, a constant work in progress, as any work of this sort must be. 
	I'll post some slightly updated ones:
<br>

<p>
Axiom 1. Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
<br>
<br>
Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
<br>
<br>
Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
<br>
<br>
Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
</p>
These statements should not sound revolutionary, but considering the current practices of the mathematical society, 
they are a pressing call to action. 
<br>
I have to admit I've been surprised to see how many mathematicians have posted these on their websites,
and even job applications. I mean, thank you. Also, let me invite you to discuss them, debate them, 
improve on them, and tell us how you bring them into action; we all learn from each other. You can
see some of my efforts in this direction <a href="http://www.fardila.com/outreach">here</a>.

<br>

About my name and pronouns: 
My full name is Federico Ardila Mantilla, recognizing the last names of my father (Ardila) and mother (Mantilla),
as is conventional in Spanish-speaking countries. I don't have a middle name, which is unusual in Spanish-speaking 
countries. Because this confuses most non-Spanish-speakers and most algorithms, I sometimes use the names Federico 
Ardila and Federico Ardila-Mantilla. Feel free to use any of these.
<br>
My pronouns are he/him in English and él in Spanish.
